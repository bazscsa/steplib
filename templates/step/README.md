# Step Annotated template

This folder contains an annotated Step template - everything what's required
to be included in your Step repository.

Technically all what's required is a *step.sh* and a *step.yml* file,
but we advise you to include at least a readme and a license file too
as a best practice.

**Read the included LICENSE file for more information about why it's
important to include a license in your open source code!**
