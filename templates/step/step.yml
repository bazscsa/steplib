  Description of the step, in **markdown format**.

  You can include [links](https://github.com/steplib/steplib)
  to help the user of the Step in the setup process (for example
  if the step requires authentication tokens for a service then you
  should include the links where the user can get those tokens).

  *You can include lists, for example a step-by-step guide*:

  1. Add this Step to your workflow
  2. Generate the required authentication tokens
  3. ?
  4. Profit

  The point of the description is to provide a good overview of
  what your step does and a guide for a new user on how to
  do the setup.

# OS tags, in this form:
#  [short-os-code]-[the.os.version.number]
# You should test your step on all the listed OS versions!

# If your step doesn't require an administrator user account
#  to run properly then you should keep this 'false'
is_requires_admin_user: false

# Inputs:
#  Inputs are a list of environment keys and user-friendly titles
#  The step runner should map the given input's content (the one the user
#   specifies) to the specified environment key.
inputs:
  - title: |
      Title of input 1
# mapped_to is the Environment Variable's name which will contain
#  the value the user provides for this input.
    mapped_to: ENVIRONMENT_KEY_OF_INPUT1
# if is_expand is 'true' then the value of this input should be
#  expanded based on the current environment variables.
# For example if it contains $HOME then before the input would be
#  assigned to the 'mapped_to' environment key $HOME should be
#  expanded to the current value of the $HOME environment variable!
# If it's false then it should be kept as a text as it is provided
#  and environment variables should _not_ be replaced with the values!
    is_expand: false
  - title: |
      Title of input 2
    mapped_to: ENVIRONMENT_KEY_OF_INPUT2
    is_expand: true

# Outputs:
#  Similar to inputs the outputs is a list environment variables.
#  Title is meant to be presented on UIs, and the "mapped_to" parameter
#   identifies the environment-key your step will generate.
#  Your step is responsible to generate these outputs,
#   it's not automatic. This list is used for connecting steps with each other,
#   your Step's outputs are expected to be available for another step
#   as input if that runs after your step.
