  ## Important note:

  This Step requires quite a good amount of setup
  and is marked for future revision to make it easier to work with.

  ## Description:

  Uploads directory to [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com/).
  You have to **authenticate your application** and add the received tokens below.

  ## Setup instructions:

  You can register a Dropbox App [here](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create).

  1. Select the API app option
  2. Files and datastores
  3. Can your app be limited to its own folder? : Yes or No, choose the one which suites you better.

  To get the required tokens you should git clone this repository,
  open the Terminal and cd into the folder which contains this file
  then run `$ bash dropbox_uploader.sh`.

  The script will present a detailed step-by-step guide
  you'll have to follow in order to generate the required
  API keys and tokens.

  It will prompt you to enter your Dropbox App's app keys
  which you can get on the *Settings* page of your app
  you registered on the [Dropbox Developer site](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps).

  The *dropbox_uploader.sh* script will present you an authentication URL,
  you have to open this URL in your browser and click **Allow**
  to grant access.

  Once you're finished with the *dropbox_uploader.sh* script
  you can get all the required keys and tokens
  from the configuration file it generates at *~/.dropbox_uploader*.

  To print the content of the configuration file
  enter this command into your Terminal: `$ cat ~/.dropbox_uploader`.

  ## Note about permissions

  > One thing to notice is that if you choose "App permission",
  > your uploads will end up on Dropbox under an App/<your_app_name> folder.
  > To have them stored in another folder, such as in /dir/,
  > you'll need to give Dropbox-Uploader permission to all Dropbox files.
