Open Step Library

*Work in progress*

# V1 roadmap

* step variations (Xcode build - common code, pre-configured variations)
* read-only inputs, default input values
  * step's responsibility or workflow/step-host-service's?
* make it work in Bitrise
* CLI
* list all available steps in Bitrise (not just the verified ones), with (platform) filtering
* minimal descriptions (StepLib website pages):
  * what is a step (intro and link to docs)
  * how to install the cli and run your first workflow - check vagrant!
